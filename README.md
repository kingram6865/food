I started leaning python in depth after taking MIT's online course Feb-March 2020
I'm improving my skills in python and I've become somewhat enamored with it after 
spending quite a bit of term learning JavaScript, Node.js and improving my PHP skills.

I originally built this project with SVN and PHP (very rudimentary PHP), and since
I'm enjoying the muance and power o Python, I've decided to try reqriting the project
in Python first. Later I will do a version using JavaScript/PHP, just to get the 
coding chops stronger in terms of variety.

The first bit of code are my experiments in testing how particular tasks will be accomplished
